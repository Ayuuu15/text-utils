TextUtils is a utility which enables you to alter your text in the way you want.
For instance, You can convert your text from lowercase to uppercase and vice-versa.
Also, You can copy your text to the clipboard. And remove extra blank spaces.
You can do word count or character count. 
One more interesting feature of TextUtils is enabling Dark Mode.
